## 0.2.0 Beta 2

**Changes**

- The MIME list used in the development web server has been extended to use Symfony's list

**Fixes**

- Highlighting code in PHP 7.3 no longer causes an infinite loop

- Redirects now work correctly when using the `serve` command
- Fix support for extra `/`s added to permalinks via Front Matter variables ([#99](https://github.com/stakx-io/stakx/pull/99))

**Development**

- Updated Twig to use namespaces after a breaking change caused stakx to fail with an updated version of Twig

## 0.2.0 Beta 1

**New**

- The `url()` Twig filter can now link to Repeater PageViews ([#78](https://github.com/stakx-io/stakx/pull/78))

- Added new `slug` Twig filter
- The 500 error page in the `serve` command now shows more useful information about the exception that was thrown
- Sass Asset Engine now caches the Sass AST it builds inside of `.stakx-cache/`. Using the `--use-cache` flag will enable stakx to read this cache and only rebuild the updated Sass ([#91](https://github.com/stakx-io/stakx/pull/91))
- The `url()` Twig filter can now handle external URLs without breaking them ([#95](https://github.com/stakx-io/stakx/pull/95))

- FrontMatter from Dynamic PageViews are now accessible through children DataItems ([#93](https://github.com/stakx-io/stakx/issues/93)); information from the DataItem will override PageView FrontMatter
- DataItems part of Datasets now have the `filePath` variable to match ContentItems
- Accidentally treating a `JailedDocument` as a string in Twig no longer crashes the compiler; it now throws a hidden warning instead
- Fixed possible route shadowing caused by permalinks being registered in the wrong order

**Development**

- The `ReadableDocument` object now has support for getting and setting metadata available to stakx internals

**Fixes**

Here's the changelog since the beta 1 release:

**New**

- Add new `build.preserveCase` option to the configuration file which allows you to preserve the case of a permalink path. This option defaults to false meaning all permalinks are still converted to lower case. ([#55](https://github.com/stakx-io/stakx/issues/55))

**New**

- Introduction of a new Repeater PageView
    - Repeater PageViews can also support automatic redirects to the permalink
- Added support for redirecting to PageViews or ContentItems
